## An assessment of the development of plant communities within restored upland hay meadows in the Forest of Bowland and the Yorkshire Dales 

For each restoration year the mean species richness and diversity. The Sorenson index of similarity to assess the similarity between plant communities in restored sites with those of donors. ANOVA2-way to test for significant differences in species richness, diversity and abundance across the seven different years of restoration. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to investigate the effect of time since restoration on plant species richness, diversity and abundance in each restored meadow and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to show differences in plant community composition between years. Presence-absence analysis of both agricultural and specialist species using the Sorenson index of similarity and linear regression analysis to explore relationships between time since restoration and the abundance of both  agricultural specialist species. 

I have managed to calculate mean species richness and Shannon's diversity for each meadow and restoration year, but so far haven't been able to test for homogeneity, normal distribution and then significance. I was hoping to carry out 2-way ANOVA and some kind of ordinations if possible. I am not sure that my dataset is in an appropriate format for doing NMDS or GLMs. Maybe 2-way ANOVA and some kind of ordination would suffice? I'm a bit lost with stats.

I have attached my dataset again as I have rearranged it a bit. 

I have attached the Mean data that I have calculated. I am currently working on calculating the richness and diversity of each quadrat within each meadow. I guess I need that data rather than the average for each meadow?
